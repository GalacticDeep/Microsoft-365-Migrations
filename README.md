# Microsoft-365-Migrations
Scripts and resources to migrate using BitTitan MigrationWiz

This is a repository of information and scripts to help with migrating from legacy systems, other cloud hosts, or even Office 365 to Microsoft 365 tenants. 
Originally I started writing scripts for a project where a service company had 200 some offices to migrate onto their Microsoft 365 tenant,
which obviously would not have worked out so well without some scripting. 

I've scrubbed client details and private info and started adding my scripts to the repo. I would love folks to add their Office 365 migration scripts to this and feel
free to fork and pull and whatever your heart's desire.
